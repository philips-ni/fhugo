## <span class="section-num">3</span> General notes {#general-notes}

Notes:

-   He mentioned he is amazed about bio-informatics
-   He also mentioned he is amazed about what helix is doing

Pros:

-   thinking and coding it loudly
-   he is confidence
-   fluent about python coding
-   Start coding with testing

Cons:

-   The implementation doesn't work for a sequence with multiple start Codon, such as "AUGAUGUGA"
-   Didn't mention validating the input until we gave the prompt
-   Single function returned Boolean and string on demand, which is not a clear interface design
-   Put major logic into inner function, which may not be good for unit test(maybe this is just my bias)
