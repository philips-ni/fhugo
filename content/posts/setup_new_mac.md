As heavy emacs user, I always need have this setting for my Iterm

```bash
Q: How do I make the option/alt key act like Meta or send escape codes?
A: Go to Preferences > Profiles tab. Select your profile on the left, and then open the Keyboard tab. At the bottom is a set of buttons that lets you select the behavior of the Option key. For most users, Esc+ will be the best choice.
```
