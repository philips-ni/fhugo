## <span class="section-num">3</span> General notes {#general-notes}

Pros:

-   Talking about a recent troubleshooting experience(email cannot be sent out), he can explain the whole process crossing different components clearly
    -   sender side
    -   receiver side
    -   OS layer
    -   Library (jar) layer
-   Asked some corner cases for clarification
    -   How about empty string
    -   How about a string like "Quickly"
-   Before coding, he read and thought about all the rules, and gave basic idea for the solution

Cons:

-   Tried to use regex, but looks like not very familiar with it , took a long time to make it working
-   Not be able to complete the coding in time, code is not in runnable state
-   Don't have time to talk about how to test it
